      <p><span class='bold'>CertCheck.me </span> is a small web project explaining security certificates while browsing internet using https. It shows how to read a certificate and understands risks of using unverified ones. It also shows ways in which certificates can be manipulaed so that the manipulating side can collect private information being tranfered over https - such as logins, passwords and other sensitive data.

      <p>When we browse the internet using HTTPS, it means our connection is encrypted and safe for sending over it our personal data. To make sure that it is encrypted with the the authentic key of the website we visit, a Certificate Authority (CA) issue a certificate to the website owners. This certificate is a way for our browser to determine if the web site we are opening is the one we can trust and are indending to visit.</p>
      <p>The problem is that certificates could be manipulated by tird parties to start MAN in the Middle (MITM) attacks: basically an attackers would impersonate the websites your are trying to connect to and intercept your data. We noticed that when browsers detect a manipulated certificate they do not explain to the users the risks associated in a clear way.  That is why we invite you to play with this website and test your browser to see how it reacts to different kinds of certificates. We emulated here some «attack scenarios», but don't worry, they are completely harmless on this web site. They are only here to make you familiar with the reactions of your browser to various HTTPS related events.</p>

This could be because the previous website certificate expired or when the services is available via multiple servers. This could be legitimate or not: it depends on a case-by-case basis. If you deal with sensitive website (e.g. your bank), you might want to avoid services that use such practices. In the worst case someone has taken illegitimate control of the CA and produced a new certificate to intercept the communication between you and the website you are visiting. Notice how a default browser configuration doesn't even bother in firefox to throw a scary window.">

Another case when this happens, if you have some kind of enterprise firewall, that does content filtering, in such cases it is custom, to install a local CA in all the browsers of the enterprise, and using this cert, the proxy is continously mounting MITM attacks against the companies employers.">

    <div style='background-color: #F0CD5C' to='/oth' class='item box' cert='Self-signed cert' info="Here you go with a completely unknown Certificate Authority and certificate. Unknown in this case means, the certificate is not shipped by your browser. Basically this can mean also different things: [1] this is a legitimate site, which does not want to buy a certificate from a CA (and then you should verify the fingerprints of the site), or [2] this is a certificate from a valid CA, which is not favored by the ruling class of CAs, but if you trust the CA you can import this yourself (e.g. there's a lot of sites with certs from a CA called CAcert), or [3] this is really a MITM attack. However, if this would be a MITM attack on a cert with a trusted CA in your browser it would be naive from the attacker's point of view, yet for sites that use self-signed certificates it makes it quite easy to MITM the connection if the fingerprints of the genuine site are not verified dilligently.">

However there is a strong community behind CAcert which makes it quite common online. This is indeed one of the few CAs that you might want to install, otherwise it's quite a good idea to remove CAs you'll never encounter naturally, like various CAs related to foreign governments. Which those are, depends of course on your current life, but a general purging of all such is neither a bad idea.">
