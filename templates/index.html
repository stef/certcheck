      <p><span class='bold'>CertCheck.me </span> is a small web project by <a href='https://tacticaltech.org' target='_blank' class='ttc'>Tactical Technology Collective</a> that explains the role of the certificate when you attempt to communicate securely with a website through HTTPS. It will help you read security warnings and understand the risks associated with unverified certificates. It also demonstrates how someone with the ability to monitor your Internet traffic could manipulate a site's certificate in order to collect information that is supposed to be encrypted, such as your password and any sensitive data you might be sending to or receiving from the website.

    </p>
    <div class='hidden'>
      <p>When you browse websites online, there is a lot happening in the background. If you access an HTTPS website, for example, your connection is encrypted. You may have heard about "certificates," which are an important part of how this sort of encryption works. In order to reassure your web browser that you are not accidentally exchanging (encrypted) information with an eavesdropper, HTTPS websites will present you with a certificate that has been signed by a trusted Certificate Authority.</p>
      <p>This certificate tells your browser that the encryption "key" you are about to rely on to protect your traffic actually belongs to the HTTPS website you are visiting. Without this reassurance, your browser will worry that an attacker might be reading everything you send to or receive from that website... and then passing it along (re-encrypted) to its original destination. Worse yet, in the absence of a trusted certificate, there would be no way for you, or the website, to know that you were being spied on. This is called a Man-in-the-Middle attack.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, your web browser is pretty good at recognising suspicious certificates. But, when it gets nervous, it's not so good at explaining why. So, we invite you to play with this website and test your browser to see how it reacts to the following scenarios. A few of them simulate attacks, but don't worry, they are completely harmless. They are just a way to for you to familiarise yourself with how your web browser describes different types of certificates.</p>

This could be because the previous certificate expired or because the website is accessible, via the same web address, from multiple servers.
     <br/><br/>
    In the worst case, however, an attacker may have taken control of this particular CA and produced a new certificate in order to intercept HTTPS traffic to and from the website. While such attacks are believed to be relatively uncommon, there is no way to tell whether or not a certificate like this is legitimate just by examining it closely.
    <br/><br/>
    If this is a website with which you exchange sensitive information, such as an email provider or a cloud storage service, you might want to keep an eye on the certificates it sends you, over the course of a week or so, to determine whether or not it behaves this way normally. If it does not (and assuming its usual certificate was not about to expire),  then you have good reason to be concerned if you see Mister Similar.
    <br/><br/>
    And remember, HTTPS encryption is important for websites that allow you 'to do' stuff (like making purchases, transferring money, downloading software or announcing things publicly) in addition to those with which you exchange confidential data. In fact, if you reuse your passphrases - which you shouldn't! - HTTPS is important for any website that requires you to sign in, because it is the only thing that hides your passphrase from online eavesdroppers.">

    <br/><br/>
    However, this could also be a sign that someone has taken control of a CA and produced a new certificate in order to intercept HTTPS traffic to and from the website. Such attacks are believed to be relatively uncommon, though they are easier to carry out than the attack described in the previous scenario, which required control of the website's *actual* CA.

    <div style='background-color: #F0CD5C' to='/cac' class='item box' cert='A valid but untrusted CA, real cert' info="In this case, the website (or someone manipulating your connection to it) has presented a certificate signed by the CACert certificate authority (CA). CACert is a pariah among for-profit CAs, in part because signs certificate for free, whereas most CAs charge something like €20 per year.
    <br/><br/>
    Because it operates outside of the industry, CACert is considered invalid by most major web browsers. However, certificates signed by CACert have more in common with the commercially signed variety than with those described under 'Doctor Self-Signed.' Specifically, a website administrator must prove that he controls the relevant web address before he can obtain a signature.
    <br/><br/>
    To generate a signed certificate for https://certcheck.me, for example, we had to click on a link that was sent by email to webmaster@certcheck.me. This would be quite difficult for an attacker to do — and nearly impossible for her to do without us noticing. It is also how many commercial CAs verify website ownership. The only real difference is that your web browser was never asked to trust CACert. But, if you want to, you can ask it to do so yourself.
    <br/><br/>
    In order to accept all certificates signed by CACert, you must add CACert's 'root certificate' to the list maintained by your operating system or web browser. (<a href='https://wiki.cacert.org/FAQ/BrowserClients' target='_blank'>https://wiki.cacert.org/FAQ/BrowserClients</a>) For better or worse, this is a rather complicated procedure. But, if you plan to exchange sensitive information with an HTTPS website that was verified by CACert, it is far safer than the alternative.
    <br/><br/>
    You should never tell your browser to accept a certificate for a particular website just because it appears to have been signed by CACert. Anybody can generate a self-signed certificate and specify 'CACert' as the 'issuer.'' Instead, you should either install CACert's root certificate or verify the cryptographic 'fingerprint', as described under Doctor Self-Signed.">

    <div style='background-color: #F0CD5C' to='/oth' class='item box' cert='Self-signed cert' info="In this case, the website (or someone manipulating your connection to it) has presented a certificate that was signed using a key that your browser does not recognise. It is extremely easy to generate such a certificate, which makes this scenario fundamentally different from the two previous examples. As a result, your web browser will show you a warning and refuse to load the page until you reassure it that you know what you are doing.
    <br/><br/>
    It is very unlikely that a large, well known, commercial website will present a self-signed certificate. Other legitimate services do use them, however, either because they can not afford to purchase a signed certificate or because they object to the notion of a corporate 'trust market.'
    Regardless, before you send anything sensitive to an HTTPS website with a self-signed certificate, you will need a reliable way to learn the 'fingerprint' of the key that it uses to protect its traffic. You can then compare this fingerprint with the one that your browser reports when you visit the website. If they match, and you tell your browser that everything is going to be okay, it will let you access the site (and warn you if it tries to use a different key at some point in the future).
    <br/><br/>
    Unfortunately, you can not yet believe anything published on the website itself, so this process typically requires asking someone who already knows the fingerprint—and whom you trust—to share it with you. And, while fingerprints are not at all confidential, you do need to make sure you get the right one, which means nobody can be allowed to tamper with it as it makes its way to you. So, if you can not meet this person face to face (and assuming you have not already worked out a secure means of communication), you should consider asking over the phone or using an online voice or video service. As long as you recognise her voice when she reads off that fingerprint, you should be fine.">

    <div style='background-color: #FF7878' to='/mtm' class='item box' cert='Faked cert and CA' info="In this case, the website (or someone manipulating your connection to it) has presented an invalid certificate signed by an 'Issuer' with the same name as the certificate authority (CA) that signed the website's real certificate. As far as your web browser is concerned, this scenario is identical the one described under Doctor Self-Signed. But, if you examine the certificate yourself, you will find that it looks more like the one described under Mister Similar (the key difference being that your browser will reject this one and refuse to load the page unless you coax it into doing so).
    <br/><br/>
    This is a common technique used by malicious Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attackers. Very few people have the ability to take control of a CA and generate valid certificates for the purpose of snooping on others. So, in order to feel clever, they do this instead. While it takes a bit more work to craft a fake certificate that closely resembles a particular website's real certificate, it is not fundamentally more difficult than generating one that is obviously 'self-signed.'
    <br/><br/>
    This certificate is one example of why you should verify the actual cryptographic fingerprint of any HTTPS website that your web browser refuses to trust (as described under Doctor Self-Signed). True, it might be easier just to compare the information on the certificates, but doing so would leave you vulnerable to attacks like this.">
